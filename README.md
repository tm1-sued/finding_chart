# Finding chart for astronomical observations
This is a small python code to produce finding charts
STSCI archive. User can specify which band (survey) for the finding chart.
To run it, change the respective parameters in the init.yml file

Code allows to parse data from SIMBAD given a list of only star names (from a list or a file) or
from a file containing the names, right ascension and declination of a list of stars.

The finding charts are obtained from STSCI archive. User can specify which band (survey) for the finding chart. 

Allows specification of the field of view.
